/**
 * Derives per-move thinking time for a line of play.
 *
 * `secondsSpent` is a plain difference between successive clock readings for
 * the same player, which is right for the whole main-time phase. It is reported
 * as null in four cases, all of them genuinely undetermined by the file:
 *
 * - the first move of a player when the root carries no `TM`, so there is no
 *   reading to subtract from;
 * - a move that crosses a byo-yomi period boundary (`OB`/`OW` changed), since
 *   the file records only the periods left, not how far into one the move fell;
 * - a move after which the clock reads *higher* than before it, which is a
 *   period renewing. The renewal discards exactly the number this would want;
 * - a move in byo-yomi after which the clock reads the *same* as before it,
 *   which is also a renewal. This one matters: a whole byo-yomi phase records
 *   the same reading move after move, so treating the zero difference as a
 *   measurement would draw a long flat run of "instant moves" over what was
 *   usually the most pressured stretch of the game. In main time an unchanged
 *   reading really does mean an instant move, so the rule only tightens once
 *   `OB`/`OW` say the player is counting periods;
 * - the move on which a player falls out of main time into byo-yomi. The two
 *   readings either side of it measure different clocks, so their difference is
 *   the main time that was left, not the time this move took.
 *
 * Guessing through those would put invented numbers next to measured ones in
 * the same series, which is the one thing a time graph must not do.
